FileMaker database to interact with AI API's

2023-10-23 - AIwork_v2.fmp12 is a Filemaker database to make OpenAI API calls. - Brian Ginn

You'll need a new api key. If you're selected on a record once you get your api call to work and then create a new record, it will copy over the setting as before. Welcome to change this to your liking. Sample request have been kept in the file so you can see what it does. - Brian

The most important finding is the "Your response will be formal and terse without comments or commentary and only pure code presented in your response." to put in the field named ai_custom_instructions_reponse. Use this when asking for a FileMaker calculation. It will respond with code that will get interpreted in field "evaluate."
